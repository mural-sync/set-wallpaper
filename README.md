# set-wallpaper

Set the desktop wallpaper using Rust.

This crate was primarily developed for `mural-sync`, but it is completely
standalone and can be used in any Rust project. However, the focus of the crate
will always be on supporting `mural-sync`'s needs. Since `mural-sync` currently
only supports Linux, `standard-directories` also supports Linux exclusively.
